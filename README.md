- Display of the total number of calories consumed in a day, and/or the average number of calories consumed in a day.
- Add a property that records when each food was eaten. The user could enter a date and time, or the app can generate a timestamp.
- Expand the application to display multiple days of food logs. Group the food entries by day. Then include a component to display the total calories for whichever day the user selects.
- Add a new master component to average the total calories consumed per day so that the user can figure out how much exercise they should be getting on a regular basis.
